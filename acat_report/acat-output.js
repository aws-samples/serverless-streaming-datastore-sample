The use of shadow accounts is  detected when the growth of the service is linearly correlated to number of accounts being created. Creating  shadow accounts in a production service is considered a security anti-pattern for the following reasons: - It contradicts with account ownership and access control. When an account is created by a service team  but the account information belongs to a customer, the ownership is not well-defined. Therefore, in situations  where the user loses access to the account, access is at risk of being granted to the wrong person/organization.  - AWS Account Event Service (AES) is a centralized service for the creation and deletion of accounts in AWS,  which is being used to apply GDPR requirements and customer agreements. With shadow accounts, customers' privacy  would be violated, as AES will not be able to send the right signals to the right AWS services. Creating shadow  accounts could cause customers to lose control over their content, e.g., a customer is unable to close a related  shadow account.   - Using shadow accounts will fail/limit fraud detection/reaction models as the account’s information is no longer  associated with the end-customer. Denied Party Screening (DPS) models, which are meant for screening accounts of a  sanctioned individual/entity/area, are also prone to fail when shadow accounts are used since users are not going  through the usual sign up/sign in process.

For chained `String.format` calls involving user input, ensure that the user input is only used in the final call, and all intermediate calls use static or hardcoded format strings with  no user input added.
